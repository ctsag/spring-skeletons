# Notes
This is a partial copy from the data-tests project. The intention is to
demonstrate how easy it is to swap Spring Data modules, going from JPA
on a relational H2 database to a directory database on MongoDB.

# Contents
This skeleton application involves the following areas :

* Data MongoDB
* Data MongoDB derived queries
* Data MongoDB paging and sorting
* Data MongoDB entity unit testing
* Data MongoDB repository unit testing
